#  Meliora Application 
Voices Unheard: Mental Health Awareness

# Application Background

Welcome to our Mental Health Advocacy Angular Application! This will guide you through the background of our application and the frameworks and components used in its development.

This project aims to create an advocacy website using Angular, a powerful framework for building dynamic web applications. The website serves as a platform to raise awareness, mobilize support, and provide resources for a chosen advocacy cause. By leveraging Angular's robust features and components, we aim to deliver a user-friendly and engaging experience for visitors interested in learning more about the cause and getting involved.

# Frameworks and Components
In the development of our application, we have utilized Angular framework along with various components to achieve the desired functionality and user experience. Angular is a popular front-end framework developed and maintained by Google. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for building single-page applications (SPAs) with dynamic and responsive user interfaces. It is used for  building client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It provides a structured way of building applications with its modular and component-based architecture.

# Why Angular?
Angular's modularity enables the creation of smaller, reusable components for easier management. With TypeScript support, developers benefit from enhanced tooling, error checking, and code maintainability. Additionally, Angular's features like two-way data binding and dependency injection streamline development by simplifying synchronization between the model and view and facilitating organized dependency management within the application.

# Angular Material
Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular applications, providing a set of reusable and accessible UI components following Material Design guidelines. It includes components like buttons, inputs, dialogs, and more, enabling developers to build consistent and visually appealing interfaces.
